#  TOPSIS Web Service

**View it here** : https://topsis-19.streamlit.app/

A web-based implementation of the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method using **Python and Streamlit**.  
This project allows users to rank alternatives from a CSV file by applying custom weights and impacts in an interactive and visually appealing interface.

##  What is TOPSIS?

TOPSIS is a **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** technique used to rank alternatives based on their closeness to an ideal solution.  
The best alternative is the one that has:
- **Shortest distance from the ideal best solution**
- **Farthest distance from the ideal worst solution**

---

##  TOPSIS Methodology

The TOPSIS algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Construct the Decision Matrix**  
   The input CSV file contains alternatives (rows) and criteria (columns).

2. **Normalize the Decision Matrix**  
   Each criterion is normalized to remove scale differences.

3. **Apply Weights**  
   User-defined weights are applied to each criterion to reflect importance.

4. **Determine Ideal Best and Ideal Worst**  
   - Ideal Best: Best values for benefit criteria, worst for cost criteria  
   - Ideal Worst: Worst values for benefit criteria, best for cost criteria

5. **Calculate Separation Measures**  
   Euclidean distance from ideal best and ideal worst is calculated.

6. **Compute TOPSIS Score**  
   The relative closeness to the ideal solution is calculated.

7. **Rank Alternatives**  
   Higher TOPSIS score indicates a better alternative.

##  Features

- Upload CSV file with decision data
- Custom weights and impacts input
- Input validation for correctness
- Automatic ranking using TOPSIS
- Downloadable ranked output CSV
- Clean, modern UI built with Streamlit

##  Input Format

- CSV file must contain **at least 3 columns**
- First column: Alternative names (non-numeric)
- Remaining columns: Numeric criteria values
- Weights and impacts must match the number of criteria

**Result Table (Output)**

1. After applying the TOPSIS algorithm, the system generates a ranked result table and provides it as a downloadable CSV file.

2. The output file contains all original columns along with the following additional fields:

3. Topsis Score
Represents the relative closeness of each alternative to the ideal solution.
The value lies between 0 and 1, where a higher score indicates a better alternative.

4. Rank
Alternatives are ranked in descending order based on the TOPSIS score.
Rank 1 corresponds to the best alternative.
